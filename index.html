                    Java has been one of the top languages to dislike basically since it's inception. And while the language
                    definetly has it's shortcomings, I don't think it deserves all of the hate it gets. Yes, the language is
                    (very) verbose, yes, it's not as fast as compiled languages and YES, there are too many <code>ServiceConfigurationBeanFactories</code>,
                    but I'll try to make a case for the language and it's surrounding ecosystem anyway.<br>
