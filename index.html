                    <p>
                    Java has been one of the top languages to dislike basically since it's inception. 
                    And while the language definitely has its shortcomings, I don't think it deserves all the hate it gets. 
                    Yes, the language is (very) verbose, yes, it's not as fast as compiled languages and YES, there are too many
                    <code>ServiceConfigurationBeanFactories</code>,
                    but I'll try to make a case for the language and its surrounding ecosystem anyway.<br>
