                <p>
                    This blog is mostly a collection of my thoughts on programming and open-source, as well as other 
                    scattered thoughts and ideas. 
                    The goal is to keep the blog as minimal as possible by only using basic HTML, very little CSS and no Javascript.
                    It is meant to be in stark contrast to modern web pages, which have gotten quite bloated and full of trackers, ads 
                    and large front-end frameworks, causing trouble even for modern hardware/internet connections.<br>
                    <br>
                    This blog is hosted on GitHub Pages and is therefore open-source as well. All of the opinions expressed in this blog
                    are my own and do not represent those of my employer, my friends or anyone else.
