                <h2>Why all the hate for Java?</h2>
                <i>Published on December 11, 2019 by Maxim Atanasov</i><br><br>
                    <p>
                    Java has been one of the top languages to dislike basically since it's inception. 
                    And while the language definitely has its shortcomings, I don't think it deserves all the hate it gets. 
                    Yes, the language is (very) verbose, yes, it's not as fast as compiled languages and YES, there are too many
                    <code>ServiceConfigurationBeanFactories</code>,
                    but I'll try to make a case for the language and its surrounding ecosystem anyway.<br>
    
                    <br>
                    I'll start by addressing some of the key complaints people have.<br>

                    <h3><i>"Java is slow"</i></h3>
                    Well, is it really? Yes, most software written in Java is slower than one written in C/C++ or any other compiled language,
                     but I don't think Java is to blame here. The JVM is (very) fast and the JDK provides tools to facilitate profiling and 
                     performance tuning. The problem, I believe, is in how most Java programmers approach writing code. People simply aren't
                     <i>trying</i> to write perfromant code. The culture around the language is such, that performance always takes a back seat 
                     to maintainablity, readability and testability. Still, a lot of Java programmers (myself included) will end up writing 
                    unmaintainable spaghetti code with no tests that is also slow. We'll also mentally support ourselves with thoughts such as:
                    <i>"The JVM will optimize this away, right?"</i>, <i>"Computers are, like, super fast nowadays y'know."</i> and the
                     widely known <i>"Premature optimization is the root of all evil!"</i>. That last one tends to be interpreted the same way as the
                     first two and that is just <i>wrong</i>! If your algorithms are slow, if you haven't put any thought into the data structures you 
                     are using and if you simply don't care about how fast your code is, then yes it will be slow and inefficent. I realize this 
                     isn't C++ where one might care about virtual (abstract) method calls indirection overhead or something like that, sure, 
                     Java programmers don't and shoudn't care about that, so go and write all those interfaces if that makes your code more readable.
                     But don't wonder why things slow down when you call 5 different Factory methods in two nested loops (Yes, I'm exaggerating a lot,
                      but you get the point). DO care about speed. At least a little bit. To this paragraph I must add that I am in no way an example 
                      in this regard. I am very much new to perfromance tuning, but I try to take it into consideration it when I write code and I can 
                      see that things do turn out better when I do so. 

                    <h3><i>"Java is verbose"</i></h3>
                      Yeah, it is. Really not much to say here. Java makes you type out everything multiple times. It's annoying
                      sometimes. <code>Person person = new Person()</code> anyone? This is partly due to the naming convention 
                      Java has. Other languages on the JVM have tried to avoid such tautologies (Scala, Kotlin, Groovy).
                      One could argue this verbosity causes confusion and eyestrain. I, personally, don't think it is <i>that</i> 
                      bad and is rather more of a <i>"This is why Java sucks!!1!"</i> kind of argument for most people. 
                      Any decent programmer will get used to it easily and the language has also gotten less verbose over 
                      the years by introducing the diamond syntax for generics, lambda type inference and recently (Java 10+) 
                      the <code>var</code> keyword (or rather type name). So yes, Java is annoying like that, but it is getting better.
                    <br>

                    <h3><i>"Java is old" or "Who uses Java anyway?"</i></h3>
                    Yes, Java is old, but so are many other languages. In fact one should see this as an advantage.
                    Partly due to it's age, it has exceptional tooling, many established libraries and frameworks 
                     and pretty much everyone has had some contact with Java. So finding a Java programmer is easy and 
                    finding a job as a Java programmer is also not a herculian task. And lots of companies, 
                    small and large, use Java as their primary programming language, especially here in Germany,
                     where everyone learns Java in university.

                    <h3><i>"The frameworks are bloated"</i></h3>
                    Many people complain that the standard way to develop web applications in Java, that being Java EE
                    or Spring-Framework, is painfuly slow to setup and bloated. I disagree. Indeed, these frameworks are huge
                    and contain code for pretty much every use case under the sun, and every other star out there (looking 
                    at you, Spring-Framework), but you don't <i>have</i> to use all of that in your application, you don't
                    even have to include it. You'll be pleasantly surprised to find out that creating a web app is extremely
                    fast. I recently built a small test application with a few REST-endpoints, minimal bussiness logic and 
                    a database behind it all in just 30-40 minutes. 

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    I think Java gets a lot of undeserved hate. The language is far from flawless, but it is also not as bad 
                    as many claim it is. I myself experience many frustrations with the language, but it's not all Java's fault.
                    More often than not, writing elegant and performant code is all in the hands of the programmer.
                    Programming languages are just tools and at the of the day, we all just want to get things done.
                    Maybe I've given someone the courage to give Java another try. If you still hate it, maybe it won't be
                    for the wrong reasons.
